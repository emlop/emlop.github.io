      <h1>Hello There</h1>
      <p>After spending a number of years as an administrator, I decided to make a career change due to my love and interest in technology. I started teaching myself by using all the free resources I could find online. From Codecademy to Youtube videos, I quickly grasped a basic understanding of web development.</p>
      <p>Balancing a full time job and learning to code on my own, I found it difficult to dedicate time to build my skills. At times, I'd code for hours straight, feeling accomplished. And other times, I would not touch my Mac for a week. I knew if I really wanted to make a career change, I had to put more work into code and learning the fundamentals.</p>
      </p>In January 2017, I was fortunate enough to have been accepted into TechIMPACT from LaGuardia Community College, a web  development immersive program. The TechIMPACT program was in partnership with General Assembly, Udacity and Software Guild. The cohort I was a part of, was the first of it's kind. We spent 7 weeks at LGCC, learning HTML, CSS and Javascript and used these skills during lab work and assignments.</p>
      <p>After this, we moved on to General Assembly Developer Bootcamp, where we spent 12 intensive weeks working with some of the industry's most brilliant developers. The grant from LGCC, gave me the opportunity to gain access to high quality, accelerated training in web development. TechIMPACT opened up a whole new world to me and for this opportunity, I am grateful.</p>
